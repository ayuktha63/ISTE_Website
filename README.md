# ISTE MBCET Website

Welcome to the official repository for the ISTE (Indian Society for Technical Education) website of Mar Baselios College of Engineering and Technology (MBCET). This project is built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and hosted on Netlify at [iste-mbcet.netlify.app](https://iste-mbcet.netlify.app).

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the ISTE MBCET website, a platform to showcase events, updates, and resources related to the ISTE chapter at MBCET. The site is developed with React and deployed as a static site on Netlify for fast, reliable hosting.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- A GitHub account (for version control)
- A Netlify account (for deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayuktha63/ISTE_Website.git
   cd iste-mbcet
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload automatically when you make changes.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder. The output is optimized and minified, ready for deployment.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. It exposes all configuration files for full customization but removes the simplicity of Create React App.

## Deployment on Netlify

The ISTE MBCET website is hosted on Netlify at [iste-mbcet.netlify.app](https://iste-mbcet.netlify.app). Follow these steps to deploy or update the site:

### Prerequisites for Deployment

- A GitHub repository with this project pushed to it.
- A Netlify account linked to your GitHub.

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Push to GitHub**
   Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit for ISTE MBCET website"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Set Up on Netlify**

   - Log in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
   - Click **New site from Git**.
   - Select **GitHub** as the provider and authorize Netlify.
   - Choose the `iste-mbcet` repository.
   - Configure the build settings:
     - **Build command:** `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory:** `build`
   - Click **Deploy site**.

3. **Custom Domain**

   - After deployment, Netlify assigns a random URL (e.g., `random-name.netlify.app`).
   - To use `iste-mbcet.netlify.app`, go to **Site settings > Change site name** and set it to `iste-mbcet`.

4. **Continuous Deployment**
   - Netlify automatically rebuilds and deploys the site whenever you push changes to the `main` branch on GitHub.

### Verifying Deployment

Once deployed, visit [iste-mbcet.netlify.app](https://iste-mbcet.netlify.app) to ensure the site is live. Check the Netlify dashboard for build logs if there are issues.
